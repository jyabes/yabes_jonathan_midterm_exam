    <h2>Why Dogs is better than cats?</h2>
    <p>Dogs are more social and interactive. 
            Dogs crave human interaction and enjoy playing fetch or going on walks. Dogs are also known to be loyal and protective of their family and home. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and often prefer to be left alone. Cats typically do not enjoy playing fetch or going for walks and are not as loyal or protective of their family and home.

    <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
    <p>Dogs are able to understand up to 250 words and gestures, while cats can understand only about 25.</p>
